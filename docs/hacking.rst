Development practices
=====================

General ideas
-------------
Code in this project should satisfy following requirements:

   - PEP8 compliant
   - Covered with testcases not less than 90%
   - Covered with documentation
   - Reviewed


Code Quality
------------

We use `pylint`_ with default settings to check the code compliance::

    pylint <your-file>

Code rated < 9 is **NOT** acceptable.

Before you commit your changes please run the unit tests

Make sure that all the test cases pass and code coverage is more than 90%.

After you fix a defect please create a test case to avoid regressions in future.

Documenting your code
---------------------

For documenting we use `sphinx`_ 
You can find project documentation in docs directory of the project

Here are recomendations of documenting API:

If you document your functions this way:

 .. literalinclude:: code/docfunc.py

 you'll have this nice documentation generated by `sphinx`:

 .. autofunction:: docfunc.foo

The same is for classes:

 .. literalinclude:: code/docclass.py

 .. automodule:: docclass
    :members:

Some useful links related to `sphinx`_:

  - http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ext/autodoc.html
  - http://packages.python.org/an_example_pypi_project/sphinx.html

Branching policy
----------------
Recommended way is to have separate git branch for each task.
After code is ready branch can be rebased against master and provided for review.

Please note that **No code should go to master without review**
It's reviewer task to review the code, disscuss it with developer, then merge it to master 
and tag it if needed.


Building Debian Package
-----------------------

Use::

    git-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -us -sa -D
	
to build packages. 

Build debian package is a recommended way to check your work, because
project documentation is re-generated and unit tests are run during package building.
